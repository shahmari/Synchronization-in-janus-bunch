### Simulation of synchronization in Janus Bunch
Here I tried to simulate the Janus Bunch device by numerically solving the dynamics of two-phase coupled oscillators.

In this [link](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/janus-bunch/) you can get a clear and detailed picture of what is Janus Bunch and you can find a good description and information about it.

If you're curious about Synchronization you can check this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg) out
